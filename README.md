Student Mental Health Awareness Data Analysis
Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the mental health status of college students, exploring various factors such as their academic year, age, marital status, CGPA, and whether they are experiencing depression or have ever had a panic attack. The goal is to identify patterns and correlations that could help in understanding the mental health challenges faced by students.
Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

    Year of Study: The current academic year of the student.
    Age: The age of the student.
    Marital Status: The marital status of the student (e.g., Single, Married).
    CGPA: The cumulative grade point average of the student.
    Do you have Depression?: Indicates whether the student is currently experiencing depression.
    Ever had a Panic Attack?: Indicates whether the student has ever experienced a panic attack.

Project Objectives

    Analyze the prevalence of depression and panic attacks among students.
    Examine the relationship between CGPA and mental health status.
    Identify trends based on age, marital status, and year of study.
    Provide insights that could inform mental health awareness initiatives on campus.
